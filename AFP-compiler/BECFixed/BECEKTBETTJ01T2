:FED.Section 64.:SKRSLUT. The issuer is required to prove that a payment
transaction has been correctly registered and booked, and that
it has not been affected by technological failure or other
errors. On the use of a payment instrument, the issuer is also
required to prove that the personal safety measure associated
with the payment instrument has been used in connection with the
payment transaction. Registration of use of a payment instrument
is not, in and of itself, sufficient proof that the payer has
approved the transaction, that the payer has acted fraudulently, or
that the payer has failed to fulfil his obligations, see Section 59.
