3.1.4 The insurance applies exclusively to the original item. This
means that if the original item is subsequently replaced with a
corresponding item, coverage of the original and now replaced item
shall cease, and the new item will not be covered. To the extent that
the insurance company may have paid compensation, the insurance
company will take over the insurance holder's right to claim
compensation from the party responsible for the damage.
