If the account holder wishes that another person (user) is to be able to
make payments using Mobile Money from the account, the user's mobile number
must be registered for Mobile Money. The user's purchases via Mobile Money
have the same legal effects as if the purchases had been made by the
account holder and according to these rules for Mobile Money. When
registering another person (user), the account holder also consents to the
registered user initiating payment transactions within the maximum limit
for Mobile Money agreed between the account holder and &BANKNAVN. to the
effect that the account holder becomes liable for such payment
transactions.
