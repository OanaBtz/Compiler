2.5. Checking account movements
:SKRSLUT.
.br
You are obliged to check the movements on your account on an ongoing
basis. If you discover any transactions which do not match your
receipts or which you believe have not been made by you, you must
contact &BANKNAVN. without undue delay. In this context, be aware of
the deadlines stated in Articles 2.6 and 2.7. In connection with your
ongoing checks of the movements on your account, note that when you
use your card to make purchases on the Internet or via mail/telephone
order, the business you deal with should not debit the sum from your
account until the goods in question have been shipped. However, when
you book airline tickets or concert tickets, the company will normally
debit the amount as soon as you book the travel or order the tickets.

the sum subsequently debited from your account is significantly higher
than what you could reasonably have expected, you may be entitled to
reverse the payment. This may, for example, occur in connection with
renting a car or checking out from a hotel, when you have allowed the
business or hotel to debit your account for refuelling the vehicle or
restocking the mini-bar.
