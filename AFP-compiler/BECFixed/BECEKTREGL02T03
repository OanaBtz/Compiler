basis. If you discover any transactions which do not match your
receipts or which you believe have not been made by you, you must
contact &BANKNAVN. without undue delay. In this context, be aware of

account, note that when you use your card to make purchases on the
Internet or via mail/telephone order, the business you deal
with should not debit the sum from your account until the

tickets or concert tickets, the company will normally debit the
amount as soon as you book the travel or order the tickets.
