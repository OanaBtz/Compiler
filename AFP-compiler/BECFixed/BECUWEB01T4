&WEBSYSNAVN allows the customer to specify his/her "NemKonto" which will be
disclosed to public authorities as the customer's NemKonto pursuant to
the Danish Act on public payments. It is the customer's own
responsibility to specify another account number or change his/her NemKonto
should the customer so wish. It is also the customer's own responsibility
to inform certain public authorities if payments are to be transferred to
a different account. &WEBSYSNAVN allows the customer to change his/her
NemKonto, but it is not possible to cancel or delete it as this must be
effected by a public authority or at
