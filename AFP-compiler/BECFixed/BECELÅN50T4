In the event of early repayment, the rate of the redemption amount must be
fixed. If the level of interest (market rate of interest) has dropped after
signing the agreement, the redemption amount may exceed the registered
unpaid debts. If the level of interest has increased after signing the
agreement, the redemption amount may be less than the registered unpaid
debts. For the purpose of fixing changes in level of interest, a reference
rate is determined.

Exchange's official list, &BANKNAVN. is entitled to select another
reference rate which is representative for the market rate. This also
applies if &BANKNAVN. considers that the average bond interest rate is no
longer representative for the development of the market rate. If
so, &deblomt. will be notified.
