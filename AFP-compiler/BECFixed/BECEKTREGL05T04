.us Card
.br
As soon as you receive your physical card, sign it in the signature field
on the reverse side. By signing the card and/or using it for the first
time, you confirm that you have read and accept the card terms and
conditions. Payment recipients will compare the signature on the card
to your signature on the purchase note. You must keep the card in a
safe place. You should check regularly to ensure that your card
or your mobile unit has not gone missing.

.us PIN code
.br
On issuing the physical card, &BANKNAVN. will
send a separate letter containing
the PIN code to your private address. Your PIN code is configured and
printed by machine, to ensure that no-one sees the code before it is
issued to you. You must inform &BANKNAVN. without delay if the letter
containing your PIN code has been opened or is otherwise not intact.
.sp 3mm
When downloading a MasterCard on a mobile phone for a wallet you make your
own PIN code for your virtual card. The PIN code is personal. You can
change your PIN code in your wallet.
.sp 3mm

.kp on
You must never store your code together with your card or write it on
the card. You should learn your code by heart and then destroy the
letter containing the code for your physical card.
You cannot be informed of your code through
personal appearance at &BANKNAVN.. If you cannot learn your code off by
heart, you must keep your code in a safe place. You should use a PIN
code reminder, which is available free of charge from any branch of
&BANKNAVN..

.us MasterCard SecureCode
.br
MasterCard SecureCode is the name of an extra measure designed to
prevent the misuse of card data in connection with purchases on
the Internet. There is added security since you must use a one-off
code - in addition to the card - when making purchases on the
Internet. You will receive this code from Nets in a text message
in connection with payment. You will only use this code for
purchases from Internet shops that use MasterCard SecureCode.
.sp
If you are not registered for MasterCard SecureCode, you cannot make
purchases from the relevant shop.

.us Special conditions regarding the card and the registered mobile phone
.br
Since your mobile phone becomes part of the security measures when making
Internet purchases from shops that use MasterCard SecureCode, you must
ensure that others do not have and cannot obtain free access to your card
as well as your mobile phone. Therefore, if you lose the mobile phone on
which you receive one-off codes, you must change/deregister the mobile
phone number with MasterCard SecureCode as soon as possible. If you lose
the card at the same time, you must also block this
