When we have been notified that you have lost your physical card or that
another person knows of your PIN code, the card will be included on a
cancellation list and thus be cancelled via MasterCard s international
authorization system.
The card will also be included on the cancellation list and cancelled if we
have a reasonable suspicion that the card has been misused.
Blocking of your physical card implies that you cannot use your MasterCard
on mobile phone either.

immediately - this is done on the website of your commercial bank or on
Nets  website. Neither do you need to cancel your card should you have
forgotten your MasterCard SecureCode. Instead, you must create a new code.
