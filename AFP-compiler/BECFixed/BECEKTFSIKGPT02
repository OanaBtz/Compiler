4.4 Double insurance
:SKRSLUT.
.br
If the items covered by the present insurance are also covered by other
insurance policies that exclude double insurance, a reservation of this
kind applies to both insurance policies. In such cases, liability is
divided between the policies in accordance with the provisions in the two
or more policies. However, the insured will never be entitled to higher
compensation from two insurance companies together than the insured could
have obtained had he/she been insured by a single insurance company.

If the compensation sum payable exceeds the insurance sum in the
individual policy but is within the total insurance sum for the
policies, the compensation obligation is to be shared between the
insurance companies in relation to the respective insurance sums.
