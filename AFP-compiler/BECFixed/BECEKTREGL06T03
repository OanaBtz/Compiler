1.4. Using your MasterCard to make a purchase or withdraw cash
:SKRSLUT.
.br
When you use your MasterCard to make a purchase or withdraw cash, the
sum is 'reserved' on your account as soon as &BANKNAVN. is notified
of the transaction. This means that the sum reserved is no longer at
your disposal. The sum is withdrawn from your account as soon as
&BANKNAVN. has received the payment demand from the payment
recipient. When you withdraw cash from &BANKNAVN.'s own ATMs and
branches in Denmark, the sum is withdrawn from your account straight away.

Please note that when you use your card to make purchases on the
Internet or via mail and
telephone orders, the payment recipient is normally not allowed to
withdraw the sum until your goods have been shipped.  If you make
purchases where payment in advance has been agreed - when you buy
airline or concert tickets, for example - the payment recipient
may, however, withdraw the amount as soon as you have booked your
journey or reserved your tickets. You cannot use your card to
withdraw more money than you have on your account. We will
therefore reject payment requests if you do not have sufficient
funds on your account.
