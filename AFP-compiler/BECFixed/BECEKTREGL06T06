When we receive notification that your physical card has been lost or that

will be added to a 'blocked cards list' and thus blocked via the
MasterCard international authorisation system. Your card number will

reasonable grounds to suspect misuse.
Blocking of your physical card implies that you cannot use your MasterCard
on mobile phone either.

have forgotten your MasterCard SecureCode code. Instead, you should
simply set up a new code.
