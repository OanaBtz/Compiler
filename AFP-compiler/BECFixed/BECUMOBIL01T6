The account holder has a duty to check the entries in the account
regularly. If, upon checking the entries, the account holder discovers
transactions which are not consistent with the transaction receipts or
which the user does not believe to have made, &BANKNAVN. must be
notified as soon as possible. In this respect, please note the deadlines
set out in clauses 11 and 12.

In connection with regularly checking the entries in the account, the
account holder must be aware that when using Mobile Money for distance
contracts, the shop is as a general rule not entitled to withdraw the
amount until the product/service has been dispatched or delivered. When
purchasing e.g. bus and train tickets or movie or concert tickets, the shop
will, however, withdraw the amount immediately when the trip is booked or
the ticket is ordered.

It is a condition that the account holder contacts and raises an objection
with &BANKNAVN. as soon as possible upon realising that one or more
unauthorised withdrawals have been made from the account. Objections must
to the widest extent possible be raised with &BANKNAVN. no later than 14
days after the account holder having discovered the potential claim. When
assessing whether the account holder has raised an objection with
&BANKNAVN. in due time, importance will be attached to the account
holder's duty to regularly check entries in the account, cf. clause 10.

&BANKNAVN. will then investigate the objection. While investigation of

assessment as to whether &BANKNAVN. has been notified in due time,
