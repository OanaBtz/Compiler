Unless otherwise stated, the rules for Mobile Money are applicable to both
the account holder and the user. The account holder may be the user, but it
is possible for an account holder to associate other users. In the event
that the account holder associates other users, the account holder must
ensure that the users are informed of these rules. If the account holder is
legally incapable, he cannot associate other users. The use of Mobile Money
is subject to an agreement being concluded between &BANKNAVN. and the
account holder on the use of Mobile Money for the mobile number in
question.
.sp 3mm

that the entire mobile number is printed on bank statements and
shop receipts. This also applies to unlisted numbers.

Please note
:SKRSLUT.
that the mobile number can only be associated to one account. If
at a later time an agreement is concluded where the mobile number
in question is associated to another account, e.g. in another
bank, the original agreement will be terminated.
.sp 3mm

Payments with Mobile Money are effected using the mobile phone. Only the

services with Mobile Money.

If the account holder or the user no longer wishes to use Mobile Money or
the mobile number is no longer used by the user, e.g. if the mobile phone
is sold, the number is changed or the subscription is discontinued, the
account holder must ensure that the agreement on Mobile Money is
terminated. If the agreement is not terminated, there may be a risk that
any new user of the mobile number will be able to use the number to make
payments from the associated account. If the mobile number for Mobile Money
has not been used for two months, the agreement will terminate
automatically.

Please note that there may be restrictions on use of Mobile Money abroad as
well as on the Faroe Islands and in Greenland. This e.g. means that a
mobile telephone with a Danish number (+45 xxxx xxxx) cannot be used to
order goods and services via short codes in a shop abroad (including the
Faroe Islands and Greenland). The shop may refer to another method for
payment, e.g. that orders must be sent via a text message to a complete
telephone number including country code.

&BANKNAVN. has set a general maximum limit for use of Mobile Money. This
maximum can be seen when establishing the agreement. The set maximum limit
depends on whether the user is older or younger than 15 years of age. The

set by &BANKNAVN.. In the event of changes to the maximum limit, the
originally concluded agreement will still apply.

no later than the following business day. However, Handelsbanken may at any
time, without incurring liability, refuse to effect payments, transfers,

used for direct withdrawals from the account associated with the Mobile
